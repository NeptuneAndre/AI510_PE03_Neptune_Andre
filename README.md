To get Jenkins running, we used Docker. We created a docker-compose.yml file specifying the Jenkins service with a custom port. 
Then, we navigated to the project directory and ran docker-compose up -d to start Jenkins. Finally, we checked the running containers 
and viewed the logs to ensure Jenkins started correctly.
